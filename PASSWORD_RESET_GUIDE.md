## 📧 Email Template for Password Reset

When using EmailJS, create a template with these variables:

### **Template Variables:**
- `{{to_email}}` - User's email address
- `{{verification_code}}` - The 6-digit reset code
- `{{app_name}}` - "Zynstro"
- `{{year}}` - Current year

### **Recommended Email Template:**

```
Subject: Reset Your Zynstro Password

Body:
---
Hello,

We received a request to reset your Zynstro account password.

Your password reset code is:

{{verification_code}}

This code will expire in 10 minutes.

If you didn't request a password reset, please ignore this email. Your password will remain unchanged.

For security reasons, this code can only be used once.

Best regards,
The Zynstro Team
